# ClueForYou

## GA Project 4

This was my final project at General Assembly San Francisco, a full time web development course. It was completed #individually# during weeks 11 and 12. 

Heroku link: https://clue-for-you.herokuapp.com

## Breif

Build a full stack web application with full CRUD functionality using a tech stack of our choice, which must be deployed to Heroku. 

__Timeframe:__ 2 weeks. 

## Concept

ClueForYou is an application where users can browse, upload and share picture trivia games (I call them picture clues, hence the title ‘ClueForYou’). 

I knew I wanted to create this application as I already had an interest in making picture clues, which I would send to my friends and family. However, I wanted to have an easier way of sharing them, and now I do!

## Features

All users can: 

* Access the homepage.
* Access the browse Page.
* Attempt the picture quizzes.

Registered users can:

* Upload their own picture quizzes, with a picture, clue and answer.
* Edit and delete their own picture quizzes.

## Build Process

Wireframes, ERD and progress can be found on my Trello board https://trello.com/b/PyNY5SIQ/final-project-clue-for-you

## Lessons Learned

I knew it would be challenging building my first individual full stack application, especially under such time pressure. It helped greatly that I had a huge interest in what I was building. I have been making picture quizzes for years and it is a great feeling finally being able to share them on an improved platform. I have gained valuable experience via this project which I look forward to carrying through to the many more project I build.
